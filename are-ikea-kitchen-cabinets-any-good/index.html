Ikea Kitchen The Good, The Bad and The Ugly! From jjhhome.com</p>
<p>25 july 2011 at 12:09pm edited 25 july 2011 at 12:12pm. I have a moderately priced house so spending $20k for custom cabinets is really not going to pay me back if i sell. I think it cost us around $7k for all of our cabinets, no appliances. Ikea cabinets are pretty good for kitchens where there is a lot of activity and they can also handle some abuse from children.</p>
<h3 id="i-know-quite-a-few-people-that-have-said-the-same-about-their-ikea-kitchens">I know quite a few people that have said the same about their ikea kitchens.</h3><p>Drawers are expensive, cover panels are expensive. Ikea cabinets are pretty good for kitchens where there is a lot of activity and they can also handle some abuse from children. Kc just got an ikea, and we are looking at the kitchens. Although my contractor did tell me at the time that the labor cost would be higher. Most positive reviews are about satisfaction in how ikea kitchen cabinets look, while most negative reviews are about ikea�s customer service. I am very pleased with the quality of the units.</p>

<p>I wanted real wood veneer, and also a custom color for some of the cabinets. Hello, we are looking at the ikea cabinets and are wondering how the quality stacks up against the big box store cheapies. Ikea carries a bunch of cabinetry styles which all range in quality.

<p>I have never had any issues with sagging or warping, drawers not closing, or hinges breaking. Drawers are expensive, cover panels are expensive. I�ve just fitted an ikea kitchen into a new extension. Another thing to consider is how much room you have available for new kitchen cabinets. You don�t have to buy ikea�s door and drawer fronts.</p>

<p>Ikea kitchens look really nice, and they�re inexpensive. The ikea kitchen sales event happens three to four times a year and runs for about six weeks.

No use in saving a few bucks if the cabinets don�t hold up. Yes, ikea kitchens are good. But if your budget does not allow for a completely custom, locally.</p>

<p>Although my contractor did tell me at the time that the labor cost would be higher. Ikea cabinets were by far the least expensive option in our area, and the quality has been at least as good as any traditional manufactured cabinets that we saw.

<p>Are ikea kitchen cabinets good quality? How many times a year does ikea have a kitchen sale? Apart from the very thin and flimsy cabinet back panel, which they break so easily!, the back of the cabinets are not actually sealing the units. Most positive reviews are about satisfaction in how ikea kitchen cabinets look, while most negative reviews are.</p>

<p>Our remodelled ikea kitchen functioned beautifully and the cabinetry held up extremely well to everyday use. We are in the midst of doing our entire kitchen with ikea cabinets! Of course, custom cabinetry is better. Some of their cabinet doors that appear to be wood are this way. I think it cost us around $7k for all of our cabinets,.</p>

<p>I feel that ikea kitchen is a wonderful merchandise for the cost. Ikea cabinets themselves are made of mdf, but there are several different door options. Naturally, custom cabinetry is way better. Why limit yourself to one single line of ikea kitchen appliances, when you could choose any appliance you want. Drawers are expensive, cover panels are expensive.</p>

<p>Although my contractor did tell me at the time that the labor cost would be higher. Also can�t get anyone on the phone. Another thing to consider is how much room you have available for new kitchen cabinets. Home depot cabinets, on the other hand, are not so.
