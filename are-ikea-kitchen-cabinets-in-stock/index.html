<p>I had ikea upper cabinets put into my kitchen 12 years ago and i am 100% satisfied. My last kitchen cost $2500 for the cabinetry and $1500 for the stock granite countertops from a small shop. In fact, the basic process of installation is really quite easy. I went to the ikea store, signed up on the little paper at the kitchen section, met with a kitchen person who i showed my design.</p>
<h3 id="23-came-into-stock-and-were-gone-in-a-day">23 came into stock and were gone in a day.</h3><p>Ikea has no capacity to just ship your items when they are all in stock so you will have some items shipped and multiple trips to the store each time something comes back in stock. Adjust the design of the upper cabinet on the walls of your room. I planned my base sink cabinet specifically with this sink in mind, but when i ordered everything, the sink was “backordered”, or so i thought. The best thing about having so many sizes available to choose from is that you can mix and match these cabinets however you desire. I was able to get one on my initial order but every day i look and ikea keeps moving the day for the next to arrive. Metod high cabinet €67, 60 x 60 x 220 cm.</p>
